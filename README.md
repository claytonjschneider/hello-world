Hi! I'm Clayton Schneider, an undergrad at University of Colorado, Boulder. I study computer science, information science, and neuroscience. Currently, I'm employed by Stateless, a software company based in Boulder. This and my previous positions have offered heavy experience in data analytics, and I'm looking to expand that into a deeper understanding of data science, software engineering, and machine learning. Eventually, I hope to create life-changing biotechnologies. Outside work and school, I read, skateboard, practice calligraphy, and play several instruments.
